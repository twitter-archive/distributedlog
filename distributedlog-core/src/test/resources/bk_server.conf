# How long the interval to trigger next garbage collection, in milliseconds
# Since garbage collection is running in background, too frequent gc
# will heart performance. It is better to give a higher number of gc
# interval if there is enough disk capacity.

# to get ledgers mapping for next gc cycle. this would help if we have pretty high

# How long the interval to flush ledger index pages to disk, in milliseconds
# Flushing index files will introduce much random disk I/O.
# If separating journal dir and ledger dirs each on different devices,
# flushing would not affect performance. But if putting journal dir
# and ledger dirs on same device, performance degrade significantly
# on too frequent flushing. You can consider increment flush interval
# to get better performance, but you need to pay more time on bookie
# server restart after failure.

# Bookie server will exit if it received SESSION_EXPIRED because it
# was partitioned off from ZooKeeper for more than the session timeout
# JVM garbage collection, disk I/O will cause SESSION_EXPIRED.
# Increment this value could help avoiding this issue

## NIO Server settings

# This settings is used to enabled/disabled Nagle's algorithm, which is a means of
# improving the efficiency of TCP/IP networks by reducing the number of packets
# that need to be sent over the network.
# If you are sending many small messages, such that more than one can fit in
# a single IP packet, setting server.tcpnodelay to false to enable Nagle algorithm
# can provide better performance.
# Default value is true.

## ledger cache settings

# Max number of ledger index files could be opened in bookie server
# If number of ledger index files reaches this limitation, bookie
# server started to swap some ledgers from memory to disk.
# Too frequent swap will affect performance. You can tune this number
# to gain performance according your requirements.
openFileLimit=20000

# Size of a index page in ledger cache, in bytes
# A larger index page can improve performance writing page to disk,
# which is efficent when you have small number of ledgers and these
# ledgers have similar number of entries.
# If you have large number of ledgers and each ledger has fewer entries,
# smaller index page would improve memory usage.
pageSize=8192

# How many index pages provided in ledger cache
# If number of index pages reaches this limitation, bookie server
# starts to swap some ledgers from memory to disk. You can increment
# this value when you found swap became more frequent. But make sure
# pageLimit*pageSize should not more than JVM max memory limitation,
# otherwise you would got OutOfMemoryException.
# In general, incrementing pageLimit, using smaller index page would
# gain bettern performance in lager number of ledgers with fewer entries case
# If pageLimit is -1, bookie server will use 1/3 of JVM memory to compute
# the limitation of number of index pages.
pageLimit=131072

#If all ledger directories configured are full, then support only read requests for clients.
#If "readOnlyModeEnabled=true" then on all ledger disks full, bookie will be converted
#to read-only mode and serve only read requests. Otherwise the bookie will be shutdown.
