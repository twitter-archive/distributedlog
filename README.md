# Apache DistributedLog (incubating)

Apache DistributedLog (DL) is a *high-throughput*, *low-latency* replicated log service, offering
*durability*, *replication* and *strong consistency* as essentials for building
reliable _real-time_ applications.

## Status

_Apache DistributedLog project graduated from Incubator at July 2017. It is now a sub-project of Apache BookKeeper._

The core components of _Apache DistributedLog_ has been merged as part of _Apache BookKeeper_. The development of _Apache DistributedLog_ has been moved under BookKeeper.
See [BP-26: Move distributedlog library as part of bookkeeper](http://bookkeeper.apache.org/bps/BP-26-move-distributedlog-core-library/) for more details.

## Features

#### High Performance

DL is able to provide *milliseconds* latency on *durable* writes with a large number
of concurrent logs, and handle high volume reads and writes per second from
thousands of clients.

#### Durable and Consistent

Messages are persisted on disk and replicated to store multiple copies to
prevent data loss. They are guaranteed to be consistent among writers and
readers in terms of *strict ordering*.

#### Efficient Fan-in and Fan-out

DL provides an efficient service layer that is optimized for running in a multi-
tenant datacenter environment such as _Mesos_ or _Yarn_. The service layer is able
to support large scale writes (fan-in) and reads (fan-out).

#### Various Workloads

DL supports various workloads from *latency-sensitive* online transaction
processing (OLTP) applications (e.g. WAL for distributed database and in-memory
replicated state machines), real-time stream ingestion and computing, to
analytical processing.

#### Multi Tenant

To support a large number of logs for multi-tenants, DL is designed for I/O
isolation in real-world workloads.

#### Layered Architecture

DL has a modern layered architecture design, which separates the *stateless
service tier* from the *stateful storage tier*. To support large scale writes (fan-
in) and reads (fan-out), DL allows scaling storage independent of scaling CPU
and memory.

## First Steps

* *Concepts*: Start with the [basic concepts](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/basics/introduction) of DistributedLog.
  This will help you to fully understand the other parts of the documentation,
  including [setup](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/deployment/cluster),
  [integration](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/user_guide/api/main.html) and
  [operation guide](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/admin_guide/main.html).
  It is highly recommended to read this first.
* *Quickstarts*: [Run DistributedLog](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/start/quickstart) on your local machine
  or follow the tutorial to [write a simple program](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/basic-1) to interact with _DistributedLog_.
* *Setup*: The [docker](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/deployment/docker) and [cluster](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/deployment/cluster) setup guides show how to deploy DistributedLog stack.
* *User Guide*: You can checkout our guides about the [basic concepts](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/basics/introduction) and the [Core Library API](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/user_guide/api/core) or [Proxy Client API](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/user_guide/api/proxy)
  to learn how to use DistributedLog to build your reliable real-time services.

## Next Steps

* *Design Documents*: Learn about the [architecture](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/user_guide/architecture/main),
  [design considerations](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/user_guide/design/main) and 
  [implementation details](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/user_guide/implementation/main) of DistributedLog.
* *Tutorials*: You can check out the [tutorials](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/main) on how to build real applications.
* *Admin Guide*: You can check out our guides about how to [operate](http://distributedlog.incubator.apache.org/docs/latest/admin_guide/main) the DistributedLog Stack.
